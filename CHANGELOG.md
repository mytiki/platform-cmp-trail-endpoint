### 3.1.0

- feat: add transaction timestamp to Records (Title, License, Payable, Receipt)

### 3.0.4

- feat: split key, auth, and registry into dedicated tiki_idp library

### 3.0.3

- fix:
    - rename TikiSdk to TikiTrail
    - remove doc references to TikiSdk

### 3.0.2

- no code changes.
- fix bug with shields in README.md

### 3.0.1

- no code changes.
- improved docs for 3.0.0 changes.
- renames the library to tiki-trail, better representing the purpose of the
  library.

### 3.0.0

- feat:
    - Adds PayableRecords for creating an immutable audit trail of compensation
      owed in accordance with a LicenseRecord.
    - Adds ReceiptRecords for connecting payments made to outstanding payables
      owed.
- fix:
    - Moves license, title, payable, and receipt methods into sub-libraries for
      use akin to namespaces.
    - Decouples title creation from license creation, opting for a more explicit
      uniform API when supporting a multitude of records.

  already been synced.

- fix: Remove Uint64Lists for web compatability.

### 2.1.2

- fix: Move key generation to Key Storage interface for web compatability.

### 2.1.1

### 2.1.0

**Expands the API to:**

- Allow customer provided IDs (instead of directly utilizing addresses)
- Allow customers to provide their own user token (JWT) for added registry
  security

**Adds logic to:**

- Sync all transactions for all addresses registered to the ID on startup
- Auto-register new addresses created to the ID
- Add an app signature (using sign key from registry) to transactions
- Interface with the l0-registry service

### 2.0.0

**Node**

- Set `maxTransactions` default to 1 (_Most applications do not require high
  throughput, and longer chains will improve the immutability strength_)

**Ownership**

- Rename ownership to title (_As in "Title Record", the standard name used for
  declaring asset ownership._)
- Rename source to ptr (_Stands for Pointer Record and is more explicit about
  its intended use._)
- Rename about to description
- Remove type (`TikiSdkDataTypeEnum`) (_They're more confusing than helpful and
  not critical to use._)
- Title records should ALWAYS have an assetRef of 0x00 ("mint" transaction")
- Update schema from `1` to an Enum AND bump version (_Contents body schema is
  changing shape._)
- Rename contains to tags (_Both more explicit and flexible._)
- Use Enum for tags, defined [here](https://docs.mytiki.com/docs/adding-tags)

**Consent**

- Rename consent to license (_As in "License Record", a more explicit and
  standard name_)
- Bug: Schema is not serialized (_Fix and use an Enum_)
- OwnershipId should be in the assetRef field, not in the contents (_See
  whitepaper_)
- Rename about to description
- Rename destination to uses, and update object structure to
  match [spec](https://docs.mytiki.com/docs/specifying-terms-and-usage).
- Bug: Fix destination/uses serialization. (_for example, `[],[]` currently
  resolves to `[][]`_)

**SDK**

- Update method names to match naming changes from above
- Rename `applyConsent` to `guard` and adjust functionality to
  match [spec](https://docs.mytiki.com/docs/enforce-license)
- Update `_checkConsent` logic to match new uses data structure
