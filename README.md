# Compliance: Trail Endpoint
REST Endpoint for creating, validating, and retrieving immutable audit trail records, such as enforceable data licenses. All writes funnel through an [AWS FIFO Queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-fifo-queues.html) for bundling as serialized sequential blocks within the immutable storage tree.
